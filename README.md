Fuel
====

‚ÄúIf a game engine could run anywhere, how would the world change?‚Äù_

Fuel was born from this single question.

`Fuel` is a minimal C89 game engine with multi-arch JIT,
hardware-accelerated rendering backends, and platform-native audio
pipelines ‚Äî built for production deployment.

It runs on [any post-2000 computer,](docs/porting.md)
from under-resourced hardware to cutting-edge systems.

## What's Fuel?

Fuel is a lightweight and flexible game engine, designed to support
creators across desktop, mobile, and console platforms.

It runs smoothly even on older or low-spec machines ‚Äî if you have a
computer, there's a place for you to create. üíªüå±

And if you're using something more powerful, like a modern MacBook or
iPhone, Fuel adapts to draw out the full capabilities of your
device. üéÆüì±

You don't need the latest hardware. Fuel helps you go beyond your
environment. It's a helpful companion for creators everywhere ‚Äî
especially in places with fewer resources.

Create at your pace, wherever you are in the world. üåç‚ú®

## Technical Overview

### Core Architecture

* **Engine Core**: Written in C89, portable and dependency-free.
* **Scripting**: Uses `FuelLang`, a custom language designed for clarity and fast execution.
* **JIT Compilation**: Built-in JIT for many architectures, with optional AOT for mobile platforms.
* **Rendering**: Supports DirectX 9/11/12, Metal, OpenGL, and a fallback software renderer.
* **Audio**: Lightweight backend supporting DirectSound, Audio Unit, ALSA, and others.
* **Small Footprint**: Runtime is less than 2MB.

### FuelLang

`FuelLang` (/Ààfj ä…ôl√¶≈ã/, "fyool-lang") is a lightweight scripting
language designed specifically for Fuel. Featuring a game-oriented
syntax, it emphasizes clarity, instant startup, and seamless
integration with the engine.

Built-in JIT compiler supports multiple architectures:
**x86, x86_64, Arm32, Arm64, PowerPC32, PowerPC64, MIPS32, and MIPS64.**

For platforms where JIT is restricted, its C source backend enables
AOT compilation, making it ideal for mobile deployment.

## Why Fuel?

Fuel is for those who quietly hold a dream, and wish to share it, one
small step at a time.

Creativity shouldn't depend on the power of your computer, where you
live, or what tools you have.

Fuel was created with the hope that every creator deserves space to
explore, no matter their surroundings.

Whether you're using a Raspberry Pi in a classroom, or using a
UN-issued Chromebook in a temporary shelter, Fuel offers gentle tools
to help bring your ideas to life ‚Äî in a way that feels simple,
thoughtful, and yours. If you have something to make, Fuel will be
here to walk with you.

Dreams fuel it ‚Äî and they're the only requirement.
