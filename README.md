## What's Fuel?

Fuel is a lightweight and flexible game engine, made to support
creators across desktop, mobile, and console platforms.

It works gently even on older or low-spec computers ‚Äî if you have a
PC, there's a place for you to create. üíªüå±

And if you're using something more powerful, like a modern iPhone or
game console, Fuel can quietly bring out the full potential of your
device. üéÆüì±

You don't need to own the latest hardware ‚Äî Fuel helps you reach
beyond your environment, making it a helpful companion for creators
everywhere, including those in places with fewer resources.

Create at your pace, wherever you are. üåç‚ú®

## Why Fuel?

Fuel is for those who quietly hold a dream, and wish to share it, one
small step at a time.

Creativity shouldn't depend on the power of your computer, where you
live, or what tools you have.

Fuel was created with the hope that every creator deserves space to
explore, no matter their surroundings.

Whether you're using a Raspberry Pi or a high-end PC, Fuel offers
gentle tools to help bring your ideas to life ‚Äî in a way that feels
simple, thoughtful, and yours.

You don't need to go fast or be loud.  If you have something to make,
Fuel will be here to walk with you.
