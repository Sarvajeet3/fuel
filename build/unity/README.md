## Commercial Console License

On commercial game platforms such as Nintendo Switch™, PlayStation® 5,
and Xbox Series X|S, the terms of each platform's SDK agreement may
restrict the use of open-source libraries that are not expressly
authorized by the platform holder. To support compliance with such
requirements, an NDA-based proprietary license of Fuel is available.
