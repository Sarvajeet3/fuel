.SH SYNOPSIS

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBfuellang\fR is the standalone compiler and runtime for FuelLang programs.

.RS
.IP \(bu

.IP \(bu
Compile a FuelLang script to a bytecode file.
.IP \(bu

.RE

Unlike \fBfuelcore\fR, \fBfuellang\fR does not support game-related APIs.  
Instead, it provides system-level functionality such as file I/O and scripting utilities  
that are unavailable in \fBfuelcore\fR.

This makes \fBfuellang\fR suitable for scripting, tooling, and general-purpose programming  
using the FuelLang language.
